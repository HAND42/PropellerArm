# How to use TOUCHGFX with ILI9341 based SPI Display

I used the instructions provided at https://helentronica.com/2021/01/22/touchgfx-on-a-custom-made-low-cost-board-with-the-ili9341-controller-over-spi/

To undertsand the implementation, visit the link provided above.


The steps to implement the code is shown in the video below

## NOTE
1. Not all the boards support touchGFX.
2. Larger projects might not work due to low memory availability.
3. The code will not work in cubeIDE for now. I will update this later.
