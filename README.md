# PropellerArm

# Introduction

Our project focuses on controlling a twin-propeller arm using a cascade control loop system. The primary goal is to achieve precise and stable control of the arm's position in response to an input angle from a potentiometer. This control is implemented by adjusting the speed of the motors to converge towards the desired angle.

## Objectives

- Implement a cascade control loop system for controlling the twin-propeller arm.
- Achieve precise positioning of the arm based on input from a potentiometer.
- Provide hands-on experience to students in robotics through practical sessions and demonstrations.
- Fine-tune control systems to optimize performance and stability.

## Project Application

This project will serve as a practical tool for educational purposes, particularly in robotics labs sessions conducted by Mr. Ducard. It aims to give students practical experience in:

- Implementing control systems in real-world applications.
- Understanding feedback mechanisms for accurate position control.
- Fine-tuning and optimizing control algorithms for stability and performance.

By integrating theoretical concepts with practical implementation, students will gain insights into the complexities of real-time control and enhance their skills in robotics and automation.
